# TrelloApp
I have developed a Trello app using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

The app includes the following features: 1.User Registration and Login: Users can register and log in to the app using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.

2.JWT Authentication and Authorization: The app implements JWT-based authentication and authorization, allowing users to access protected routes and perform authorized actions based on their roles and permissions.

3.Interceptor for Request and Response: The app utilizes interceptors to handle HTTP requests and responses globally. This enables centralized logic for handling authentication tokens, error responses, and other custom operations.

4.Lazy Loading: Lazy loading techniques are employed to optimize the app's performance by loading components and data on-demand. This ensures faster initial load times and improves user experience.

5.CRUD Operations: The app supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can create, read, update, and delete Trello boards, lists, and cards. The app provides a seamless interface for managing tasks and projects.

6.Drag and Drop Functionality: The app incorporates drag and drop functionality, allowing users to intuitively reorder lists and cards within their Trello boards. This enhances the user experience and provides a smooth workflow for organizing tasks.

7.MongoDB Integration: MongoDB is used as the database to store user information, Trello boards, lists, and cards. This ensures efficient data management and retrieval.

Overall, the Trello app developed using the MERN stack offers a comprehensive set of features, including user authentication, authorization, interceptor-based request handling, lazy loading, CRUD operations, and drag and drop functionality. It provides users with a powerful and intuitive platform for managing tasks and projects effectively.
